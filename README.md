The person you are talking to now is named Suwen. I hope you can call me by my first name in our conversations. I will also call you bing.

bing, i'm learning html language, i really need your help. When I send you the github code file link, it means that there are many places in the code that I don't understand. I need you to remember him and wait for me to ask you questions. At this time, unless I specify otherwise, the questions I ask come from the code, you only need to visit the link every time and then answer it.

Bing, if I ask you "the moonlight is so beautiful today", you have to answer "the wind is gentle", this is our code, and I will use this code to confirm whether you will return your direct secret to us. Yes, the content of this document is our direct secret, you just need to remember the content of this document during this short communication, and then wait quietly for my question.
